# How to Add Background Footage to Resume Page

## Option 1: Video File (Recommended for smooth effect)

### Steps:
1. **Place your video file** in the project root:
   - Name it: `background-video.mp4` (or `.webm`, `.mov`)
   - Or put it in an `assets/` folder: `assets/background-video.mp4`

2. **Supported formats:**
   - `.mp4` (most compatible)
   - `.webm` (smaller file size)
   - `.mov` (if needed)

3. **I'll update the CSS** to use it as a background video

### Video Requirements:
- **Resolution**: 1920x1080 or higher (will scale down)
- **File size**: Try to keep under 10MB for web (or compress it)
- **Duration**: Can be looping video or long clip
- **Format**: H.264 codec for best compatibility

## Option 2: Image File

### Steps:
1. **Place your image** in the project root:
   - Name it: `background-image.jpg` (or `.png`, `.webp`)
   - Or put it in an `assets/` folder: `assets/background-image.jpg`

2. **I'll update the CSS** to use it as a background image

### Image Requirements:
- **Resolution**: 1920x1080 or higher
- **File size**: Optimized for web (under 2MB recommended)
- **Format**: JPG (best for photos), PNG (if transparency needed), WebP (smallest)

## Option 3: External Link (If already hosted)

If your footage is already hosted somewhere (like Vimeo, YouTube, or your Wix site):

1. **Provide the URL** to the video/image
2. **I'll update the code** to reference it

---

## Option 4: Upload to Project

### Quick Steps:
1. **Drag and drop** your video/image file into the project folder:
   ```
   C:\Dev\aaditkannancom\
   ```

2. **Or create an assets folder:**
   ```
   C:\Dev\aaditkannancom\assets\
   ```
   Then put your file there

3. **Tell me the filename** and I'll integrate it

## What I'll Do Once You Provide It:

1. ✅ Add the background to the resume page
2. ✅ Add dark overlay (like your home page) for text readability
3. ✅ Make it responsive
4. ✅ Optimize for performance
5. ✅ Add smooth fade-in effect

---

## Current Setup

Right now the resume page has a solid black background. Once you provide the footage, I'll:
- Replace black background with your video/image
- Add the same dark overlay effect
- Keep all animations and scroll effects working
- Maintain performance (lazy loading, etc.)

## Questions?

- **What format is your footage?** (MP4, JPG, etc.)
- **Where is it currently?** (On your computer, Wix, YouTube, etc.)
- **Do you want it on all sections or just the Overview section?**

Just let me know and I'll integrate it! 🎬
