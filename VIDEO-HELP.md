# How to Add/Check Your Background Video

## Current Video Location
Your video should be at: `C:\Dev\aaditkannancom\assets\background-video.mp4`

## If Video Isn't Showing:

### Option 1: Check if file exists
1. Open File Explorer
2. Go to: `C:\Dev\aaditkannancom\assets\`
3. Check if `background-video.mp4` is there

### Option 2: Re-add the video
1. Find your video file: `C:\Users\aadit\Downloads\Untitled video (2).mp4`
2. Copy it to: `C:\Dev\aaditkannancom\assets\background-video.mp4`
3. Make sure it's named exactly: `background-video.mp4`

### Option 3: Alternative video formats
If MP4 doesn't work, try:
- `background-video.webm` (smaller file size)
- `background-video.mov` (if needed)

Then update the HTML to use the new filename.

### Option 4: Check browser console
1. Open browser (F12 or right-click → Inspect)
2. Go to "Console" tab
3. Look for any red errors about the video
4. Tell me what errors you see

### Option 5: Video file too large?
- Large videos (>50MB) might not load well
- Try compressing it or using a shorter clip
- Or use an image instead temporarily

## Quick Test
Open in browser: `http://localhost:3000/assets/background-video.mp4`
- If it plays → video file is fine, path issue
- If it doesn't → video file problem

Let me know what you find!
